# Predict-the-Yelp-rating-text-review---NNLP-Project
In this problem, I will predict the Yelp ratings (good or bad),in the review text. Used only those reviewswhich have either a 5 star or 1 star rating(for good or bad binary classification). Rest of the reviews with 2,3 or 4 ratings can be removed from the data.
